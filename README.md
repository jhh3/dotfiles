## Installation

To get started please run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jholliman/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make
```

## Wait, you're not done! Do this:

#### Install iTerm Thayer Colors

Download and install the [thayer colorscheme](https://github.com/baskerville/iTerm-2-Color-Themes/blob/master/thayer.itermcolors) 

#### Remap caps-lock to escape with [PCKeyboardHack](http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html)

The escape key is the single most used key in vim.  Old keyboards used to have Escape where Tab is today. Apple keyboards are the worst with their tiny Esc keys. But all this is fixed by remapping Caps to Escape.  If you're hitting a small target in the corner, you are slowing yourself down considerably, and probably damaging your hands with repetitive strain injuries.
